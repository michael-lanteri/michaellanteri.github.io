            <p>Michael is a computer science student at the University of Connecticut.</p>
            <p>Since I began my studies in 2023, I have been involved in the development 
                process of a number of projects.</p>
            <p>In doing so, I have developed a strong focus in software and product design.</p>
            <p>With this target in mind, I aim to work with creatives to transform abstract thoughts 
                into tangible solutions.</p>
